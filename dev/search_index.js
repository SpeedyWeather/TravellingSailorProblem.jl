In analogy to delivering Christmas presents to children around the world these are\n\nusing TravellingSailorProblem\nchildren = TravellingSailorProblem.children(26)\n\nTheir names are in alphabetical order for easier identification when Visualising destinations, their respective locations are the same for every user of TravellingSailorProblem. Initially they are set to reached=false as they haven't received any parcels (=Christmas present) yet.  You can create fewer destinations which will just pick the first N of those 26, e.g.\n\nchildren = TravellingSailorProblem.children(5)","category":"section"},{"location":"destination/#Visualising-destinations","page":"Destination","title":"Visualising destinations","text":"The 26 destinations (children) are somewhat uniformly distributed all over the globe in various places (all on land).

Choosing fewer children will only visualise those. If you want the perspective on a particular destination you can pass that on as perspective = destination, e.g. children[2] is a destination (children is a tuple of destinations) if you have at least 2 children defined\n\nusing TravellingSailorProblem, GLMakie, GeoMakie\n\nchildren = TravellingSailorProblem.children(26)\nglobe(children, perspective=children[2])\nsave(\"destination2.png\", ans) # hide\nnothing # hide\n\n(Image: )\n\nIn this documentation that visualisation is static but if you do this in the Julia REPL you will get an interactive visualisation where you can rotate and zoom. You can also provide a perspective with coordinates, e.g. perspective = (0, 52) to look down onto London, UK.\n\nYou can also change the altitude, typical values are between 1e6 (country level) and 2e7 (global view), e.g. to zoom onto London do\n\nglobe(children, perspective=(0, 52), altitude=1e6)\nsave(\"destination_london.png\", ans) # hide\nnothing # hide\n\n(Image: )\n\nBy default a \"shadow\" is visualised below each destination to illustrate its radius a particle has to reach for the destination to be marked \"reached\". Unreached/missed destinations are marked in yellow but they turn purple if a particle gets within the radius!","category":"section"},{"location":"particles/#Particle-advection","page":"Particle advection","title":"Particle advection","text":"There are several steps for particle advection in SpeedyWeather.

It takes the spectral_grid as the first argument and then keyword arguments for every non-default model component. If you look at model it's quite lenghty as it shows every single model component, from numerics, to output to parameterizations that are used inside a simulation.

For that we create a particle tracker as follows, again passing on spectral_grid as the first argument\n\nparticle_tracker = ParticleTracker(spectral_grid)\n\nThere's many options but we won't touch those or elaborate them here. Important is however that creating a particle tracker doesn't mean it's part of the model. For this we do\n\nadd!(model, :particle_tracker => particle_tracker)\n\nAs the ParticleTracker is implemented as a callback you can provide a key (a name) for it, like here :particle_tracker but you could also give it your own key like :my_tracker or simply do\n\nadd!(model, particle_tracker)\n\nin which case a random key is chosen as printed with an [ Info: note. But beware now we have added the same particle_tracker twice but with two different keys in which case the same particle_tracker will be called twice on every time step – probably not a good idea. You can always check which callbacks you have added with\n\nmodel.callbacks\n\nand delete callbacks with delete!(model.callbacks, :key).  We delete one particle tracker by specifying its key, so that only the other one remains\n\ndelete!(model.callbacks, :particle_tracker)\n\nNote that also the children are implemented as callbacks so you will likely see a list of both Destinations (the children) and the particle tracker!\n\nwarn: Do not add one particle tracker twice with different keys\nOtherwise the second will interfere with the netCDF file created by the first.","category":"section"},{"location":"particles/#Initial-conditions","page":"Particle advection","title":"Initial conditions","text":"When the model is initialized it returns a simulation which contains that model as well as variables among which are the particles.

By default these particle initial conditions are uniformly random across the globe but you can manually choose the initial conditions with\n\nparticles[1] = Particle(-30, 50)  # lon, lat in degrees\n\nYou can use both (0, 360˚E) or (-180, 180˚E).

Visualising 1000 particles advected for 1 day will give you a good overview of how the wind is blowing.

Imagine you get a Christmas present that flew through both the Arctic as well as Antarctica!\n\nAdditionally, we use\n\nTravellingSailorProblem.POINT_FACTOR_AT_SURFACE\n\ntimes higher points for particles that flew on the lowermost vertical layer compared to the uppermost. This calculation is done in Sigma-coordinates so when choosing layer=1 (top) one gets 1.0625 points per km flown, but on layer=8 (surface) one gets 1.9375 points per km flown. The reason is that the wind is more turbulent at the surface but more laminar higher up. To incentivise low-flying presents we therefore introduced this point-multiplier.\n\nHowever, if a child doesn't get a Christmas present we give\n\nTravellingSailorProblem.POINTS_PER_KM_MISSED\n\n(note: NEGATIVE!) points for every km the closest particle ever was to a child. If you live on Hawai'i and no particle doesn't even get near you, you would also be pretty disappointed no?
